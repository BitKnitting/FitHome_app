## Thanks to Those That Went Before
- [Steve Schmidt](https://player.fm/series/the-energy-show/home-energy-analytics-with-steve-schmidt) for his Home Energy Analytics work and [Homeintel company](https://www.hea.com/hea-web/CSP-020.jspage?prepareForm=true&loc=consol&coach=8365).  He identified electricity use categories that we have evolved in our knowledge transfer between the fitHome app and the homeowner.
# Insights
The core to the FitHome experience is to give personalized advice (insights) on how the homeowner can reduce their electricity consumption without significant changes to their lifestyle.
## How Insights are Determined
Insights are determined  by collecting and analyzing the electricity readings.  The findings made after analyzing the electricity readings are then displayed to the homeowner within this app,
## Categories
We break our display of insights into categories evolved from what Steve Schmidt discussed in [The Energy Show podcast](https://player.fm/series/the-energy-show/home-energy-analytics-with-steve-schmidt)
- __Always On__: This is the electricity being sucked up by the homeowner's devices all the time.  24 hours a day.  7 days a week.  These are the TVs, kitchen appliances, etc.  That are plugged in, always using at least some energy.  A [Sense blog post](https://blog.sense.com/articles/what-is-always-on-power/) noted that "_[A study by the Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/keep-your-devices-wasting-energy-and-money) found that the energy use from Always On devices across the US accounts for 23% of power consumption in the average household, or a quarter of any given electricity bill._"  Clearly, 23% is a lot of electricity being sucked up by devices we're not using at 3AM!  A goal of ours is to get homeowners using 15% less electricity.  A significant portion of the 15% savings will come from identifying and preventing wasteful Always On electricity use.
